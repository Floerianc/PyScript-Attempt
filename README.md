A very simple project to test PyScript
(It was very painful (the documentation is very bad (and outdated sometimes lol)))

To be honest tho, the documentation was very confusing especially because some links
on their documentation just didn't exist anymore lol

Anyway, to use this you need a server or something.
I personally just used Live Server in Visual Studio Code and it worked fine.
I hope you'll like this ^-^
